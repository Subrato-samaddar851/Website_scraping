We are given a task to scrape data from the Wikipedia page titled "List of active Indian military aircraft" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Indian_military_aircraft). I have done it using Python language and some libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup and pandas. We used pandas library to create dataframe. I have created CSV file with the name Indian_Military_Aircraft which is attached. Finally, I have extracted some useful data from wikipedia page.
